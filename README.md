# Quantium-Data-Analytics

I HAVE DONE THE VIRTUAL INTERNSHIP THROUGH FORAGE WITH QUANTIUM IN DATA ANALYTIC FEILD WHERE I WORKED UPON ANALYZING THE DATA OF CERTAIN RETAIL STORE WHO SELLS THE CHIPS PACKETS. THERE I HAVE TO CHECK CERTAIN PARAMETERS LIKE WHICH AGE GROUP OF PEOPLES BUYING THE CHIPS PACKETS AND WHETHER THEY ARE BUYING THE SINGLE PACKETS OR BUYING IN BULK. SO UPON ANALYZING THE CSV DATA SET PROVIDED BY THE QUANTIUM I GET THAT THE PEOPLE ARE BUYING THE CHIPS PACKETS IN BULK WHICH REDUCES THE COST PER PACKET FOR THEIR CHILDRENS. AFTER ANALYZING I MADE THE REPORT UPON HOW THE STORES CAN INCREASE THEIR SALES THROUGH CERTAIN CAMPAIN WHICH ATTRACTS CUSTOMERS AND HENCE THE SALES OF CHIPS WOULD BE MORE AND ALSO THEY SHOULD APPLY CERTAIN DISCOUNT UPON THE BUYING IN BULK OF CHIPS PACKETS
